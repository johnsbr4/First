Roguelike Personal Project
================================

Creative name, no? Simply put, this is a personal project of 
mine to create an initially simple roguelike game that I can work on and
play with over a period of time.

I used the roguelike tutorial on www.roguebasin.com, following it step-by-step to
wade myself in to the libtcodpy library. I finished all 13 available tutorials, so now
the plan is to improve, modify and change the game to make it bigger, better and more 
interesting.

Who am I?
--------------------------------
I am a computer science undergrad at Oregon State University. My experience 
and knowledge of programming is...let's just say I'm no Linus Torvalds. But
I am always looking to improve and learn, and welcome any opportunity to do
so.
