Roguelike Personal Project
================================

Creative name, no? Simply put, this is a personal project of 
mine to create an initially simple roguelike game that I can work on and
play with over a period of time.

Who am I?
--------------------------------
I am a computer science undergrad at Oregon State University. My experience 
and knowledge of programming is...let's just say I'm no Linus Torvalds. But
I am always looking to improve and learn, and welcome any opportunity to do
so. 

I am using the Roguelike tutorial found here:
